# Basic-9
A simple BASIC code that calculates the average of a set of numbers.

In this code:

- The program first prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to average using the INPUT command.
- It initializes a variable SUM to 0 to store the sum of the values.
- It then uses a FOR loop to iterate from 1 to N, where N is the number of values.
- Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter each value and adds it to the SUM.
- After all values have been entered and summed, it calculates the average by dividing SUM by N.
- Finally, it prints out the calculated average.
This code demonstrates how to use loops and user input to calculate the average of a set of numbers.
